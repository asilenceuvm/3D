# 3D Engine
This is a program that I wrote that runs a game in a fully 3d enviornment. 
It uses no outside libraries or other files, it is written solely in java.
It is not a finished product yet, it still has many problems and bugs to be resolved.

Thanks to https://github.com/javatutorials101/Tutorials for the idea behind the 3d engine, as well as much of the math.

Thanks to CodeNMore (https://www.youtube.com/user/CodeNMore) who I learned how to program from. 
I used much of the structure he wrote for the program.


This program won 2nd place in the intermediate programming category of UVM's annual computer science fair in 2018.
